class _Hooks:
    """:class:`~._Hooks` execute an action or set of actions at specific stages of operation execution.

    :class:`~._Hooks` can execute a user defined function when an operation
    starts, succeeds, fails, or finishes (regardless of whether the operation
    executed successfully or failed).

    Hooks can be installed at the operation level as decorators, or on an
    instance of :class:`~.FlowProject` through
    :meth:`~.FlowProject.project_hooks`.

    Examples
    --------
    The example below shows an operation level decorator that prints the
    operation name and job id at the start of the operation execution.

    .. code-block:: python

        def start_hook(operation_name, job):
            print(f"Starting operation {operation_name} on job {job.id}.")

        @FlowProject.operation
        @FlowProject.operation_hook.on_start(start_hook)
        def foo(job):
            pass

    Parameters
    ----------
    on_start : list of callables
        Function(s) to execute before the operation begins execution.
    on_finish : list of callables
        Function(s) to execute after the operation exits, with or without errors.
    on_success : list of callables
        Function(s) to execute after the operation exits without error.
    on_fail : list of callables
        Function(s) to execute after the operation exits with an error.
